TOP - 2012 Apple Website HTML &amp; CSS Clone

This project is part of The Odin Project's Curriculum [https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/html-and-css/lessons/building-with-backgrounds-and-gradients#assignment]


The goal of this project was to build a clone of a 2012 Apple website linked here [https://web.archive.org/web/20140301004610/http://www.apple.com/]

The finished clone can be viewed here [https://rueeazy.github.io/apple-clone/]

I built this website using CSS Grid and flexbox.
